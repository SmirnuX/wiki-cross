## Features

 - Dark theme
 - English and russian localizations
 - Four types of hints
 - Difficulty selection (higher the difficulty - lesser hints and more difficult words)

## Types of hints
 - Show first picture from article (can be unaccesible for some pages)

 - Highlight wrong letters in chosen word
 - Put three letters in chosen word (priority is given to empty cells, then to wrong letters)
